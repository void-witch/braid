## questions

if you're just looking to ask a question, feel free to start a new [discussion](https://github.com/void-witch/braid/discussions) with any questions you might have

## how to contribute

if you have a bug report or a feature request, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/void-witch/braid/issues), and someone may fix your bug or implement the suggestion

if you would like to contribute a bug fix, please feel free! we just ask that you follow the "guidelines for contributing code" section below

if you'd like to contribute a feature, feel free to do that as well! just follow the "guidelines for contributing code" section, and consider starting a discussion asking if there's interest in accepting the feature before doing a lot of work

### guidelines for contributing code

1) fork the code
2) create a new branch: preferred naming scheme is `issue-$num` if fixing an existing issue, or a short and descriptive name otherwise i.e. `implement-gui`
3) testing: if fixing a bug, create a new test case to ensure the bug is not reintroduced in the future. if adding a new feature, add unit tests as needed to ensure the feature works as intended
4) commit often: small, self-contained commits are easier to read than a single 1000 line delta
5) don't squash: similar to 4, squashing makes it hard to examine code. if your patch contains multiple commits, the maintainer will squash them when accepting
